# Hands-on lab cognitives services and Artifical Intelligence
Welcome on this Hands-on lab cognitive services AI for Microsoft Azure Red Shirt Tour.

As you may know, Artifical Intelligence, machine learning and cognitives services are very helpful to disrupt your digital applications. In this lab, you will see the power of Azure IoT Hub, Azure Machine learning Studio, PowerBI, cognitive services and chatbot.

The goal is to play with all of these technologies to build APIs, deploy them on the cloud and invoke them on cross-platform applications.

This tutorial will guide you to build the following smart use case:

__Context:__ intervention and troubleshooting in a connected factory

__Scenario:__ machines of a connected factory push data thanks to different IoT sensors. Information reported is processed by machine learning and stream analytics.
If marginal values are identified, a human intervention is triggered to check the machine.
The human operator moves to the machine. Its presence is detected by the information system through face detection.
Then he starts the checkpoint verification process with the chatbot. The bot rolls out the checklist and the operator enters a response / result to each question asked by the bot.


To achieve that you just have to follow the instructions on each part in the specified order.

1. [IoT](https://github.com/Spycker/HandsOnLabDataAI/tree/master/1-IoT)
2. [Face detection](https://github.com/Spycker/HandsOnLabDataAI/tree/master/2-FaceDetection)
3. [Chatbot](https://github.com/Spycker/HandsOnLabDataAI/tree/master/3-Chatbot)
4. [PowerBI](https://github.com/Spycker/HandsOnLabDataAI/tree/master/4-PowerBI)
5. Xamarin (bonus)

**Enjoy and have fun !**
